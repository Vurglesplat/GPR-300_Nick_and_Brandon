# Project 1 Guide
This is a relatively simple project so there isn't too much that needs to be explained outside of opening it and using controls.

Opening:
 - run LAUNCH_VS.bat as an administrator, and once visual studio has loaded in simply build and run the program, once it is running, select the file menu -> Load demo... -> Animal3d Demo Plugin
 
 Once that is done the controls will be displayed on screen and you can enjoy this test run of various shaders for graphics.
 If you accidentally hide the display, typing a capital T will display it again.

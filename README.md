# Project 5 Guide

### Opening
 > run LAUNCH_VS.bat , and once visual studio has loaded in simply build and run the program, once it is running, select the file menu -> Load demo... -> Animal3d Demo Plugin

### Contents
Once the animal3d framework is running the program, a demonstration of the various foundational stages of animation will begin running on the screen.
There aren't that many controls that directly tie into this specific project, as they're mostly greared for the rendering stages than animation, the only control that may be useful would be pressing 'm' to pause the animation

If you accidentally hide the display, typing a capital T will display it again.
